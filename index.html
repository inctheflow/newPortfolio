        My name is Aditya Raj Poudel. and I am an aspiring game developer.
        Another thing about me is that I am not scared of Maths. I am always excited about solving for something. It gives different perspective to everything.</p>
        <p>
Currently, I am living in Baltimore, MD. I'm pursuing a bachelor's degree in Computer Science, driven by my passion for technology, mathematics and problem-solving. I was born
and raised in serene hills of Nepal. I moved to USA on fall of 2023.
My ultimate goal is to become a game developer and create immersive and interactive experience through interactive storytelling. I am fascinated by the intersection 
of creativity and technology and enjoy exploring new tools and techniques. Whether it's coding, designing or solving problems, I am always eager to improve and learn more.
<br>Enough of professionalism, I love swimming, table tennis(ping pong if you are an American), sleeping, eating and this list is in priority order. I love to play and watch football
(soccer if you are an American) and cricket.
